Solution Explanation:
I used a nested loop to generate all consecutive substrings.
The outer loop chooses a starting position.
The inner loop chooses the ending position and slices the substring.
This ensures the substrings are consecutive and in the correct order.

Time Complexity:
The algorithm runs in O(n^2) time.
This is because for every starting index we loop through all remaining characters.
