Solution Description:
The solution uses nested loops to generate all consecutive substrings of a given string. 
The outer loop selects the starting index, and the inner loop selects the ending index. 
Each substring is extracted using str.slice() and stored in an array. 

Time Complexity:
O(n^2) - the number of substrings grows quadratically with string length.

Space Complexity:
O(n^2) - for storing all substrings in an array.
